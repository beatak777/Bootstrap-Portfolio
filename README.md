# Beata Konya's Bootstrap Portfolio


# <a name='Description'></a>Description

Beata Konya's Bootstrap Portfolio was designed to showcase the knowledge that I have utilised during my bootcamp experience with EdX. The webpage was created with bootstrap attributes.

Overview of the project:
* Created the repo with the name "bootstrap-portfolio" as it was requested by the Challenge.
* Used Bootstrap's navigation bar code for a user-friendly navigation system.
* Customized the navigation menu with strategically placed links to relevant sections on page.
* Developed a visually appealing jumbotron for the hero section.
* Added a picture, name, and personalized information for an engaging introduction of the page.
* Utilized Bootstrap cards for a grid layout showcasing projects, included a concise project overview, serving with a link to the projects.
* Listed anticipated skills to be gained from the bootcamp.Created an About Me segment within the same row.
* Integrated hyperlinks in the contact me/ footer/nav section with hover effects, also added box shadow effects to the buttons.
* Minimized the use of media queries for a consistent experience across devices.
